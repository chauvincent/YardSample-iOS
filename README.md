YardRental-iOS
===================

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> About

This is an iOS application exercise to read in some JSON and to create the main screen UI of a heavy duty rentals application. Written in Swift 3.0. The main screen is finished, and the custom menu bar navigation is completely finished. 

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Remarks / What's next:
I will most likely make a CocoaPod for the CustomMenuBar in the near future. The UITabBar() class does not allow one to use multi-line labels with no icons for a UITabBarItem like my screenshots below. Not doable because UITabBarItem() does not inherit from UIView and cannot access its private textLabel.
